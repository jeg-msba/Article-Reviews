## Skills-Based-Hiring-Review.pdf

In the early 2000s employers began adding degree requirements for jobs that previously did not require degrees. The researchers hypothesized that employers felt 
that the social skills, teamwork, and commitment 
acquired by students receiving college degrees was a good proxy for having the skills needed to succeed in their work environment. During periods 
of worker shortages, such as the years following the 2009 recession and the 2020 COVID pandemic, employers reviewed their job postings and removed 
unnecessary degree requirements to speed up the hiring process and reduce the worker shortage. Burning Glass Institute published a paper, 
“Skills-Based Hiring: The Long Road from Pronouncements to Practice” (Sigelman, 2024), lamenting the failure of this initiative to make a meaningful 
change in the hiring of non-degree workers. In this article review I summarized the paper’s findings and suggest an experiment that could help employers 
identify the source of the hiring failure and point to ways to improve the hiring process.


## Customer-Segmentation-Article-Review.pdf

In the article,” Improving customer segmentation via classification of key accounts as outliers” (Spoor, 2022), the researcher presented a methodology 
to improve customer segmentation using a two staged approach. The first stage removes key accounts that businesses typically handle with separate sales, 
marketing and support teams. The second stage uses cluster analysis to segment the remaining customers. The results of this two-stage approach are compared 
to an earlier study that used the same data but with only a single stage clustering methodology. The clusters derived from the two-stage approach show better 
differentiation than the one stage approach on the same data set with the added benefit of identify key customers that should be treated differently than the rest.
